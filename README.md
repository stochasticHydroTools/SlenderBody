This repository contains the Python/C++ codes for
"An integral-based spectral method for inextensible slender fibers in
Stokes flow," by Ondrej Maxian, Alex Mogilner, and Aleksandar Donev. 

The directory Python/Examples contains the python scripts to reproduce 
the tests in the paper. See the read me there for more information.
