Testing directory for FINUFFT. Barnett 3/14/17

check_finufft.sh : validates the NUFFT library for correctness.
results/*.refout : reference outputs that the generated outputs *,out will be compared against.
spreadtestnd.sh : performance test of spreader only, in dims 1,2, or 3.
nuffttestnd.sh : performance test of NUFFT library, in dims 1,2, or 3.
mycpuinfo.sh : prints info about the CPU
check?d.sh : used by check_finufft.sh

Possibly obsolete scripts (for developers):
nuffttest?d.sh : simple NUFFT test for each dim
checkallaccs.sh : spreading and NUFFT at all #s of digits, for a single ndims
highaspect3d_test.sh : comparing various pizza-box orientations for speed

Also see: ../fortran for the Fortran driver demo scripts.
