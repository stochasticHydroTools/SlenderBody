Julia interface
===============

Ludvig af Klinteberg has built `FINUFFT.jl <https://github.com/ludvigak/FINUFFT.jl>`_, an interface from the `Julia <https://julialang.org/>`_ language. This package will automatically download and build FINUFFT at installation, as long as GCC is available. It has been tested on Linux and Mac OS X (the latter with GCC 8).
