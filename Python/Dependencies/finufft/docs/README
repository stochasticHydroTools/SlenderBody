README for FINUFFT documentation.

Barnett 1/28/18



The files in this directory are designed for sphinx to auto-generate
documentation in HTML (including from the readthedocs.io site), and in PDF.

To test the HTML generation locally, do:

  make html

Then point your browser to the local file _build/html/index.html

Before pushing to git after documentation changes, one should also do:

  ./genpdfmanual.sh

This is a tiny bash script which builds the PDF manual then moves into
the parent (main FINUFFT) directory for easy reading offline by
non-browser-based humans who download the repo.  The file ../README.md
also exists for such humans, and those reading the github front page.

finufft.readthedocs.io should have been set up to be triggered by
pushes to the git repo to regenerate HTML documentation identical to the
local copy, hosted there for the world to see.
