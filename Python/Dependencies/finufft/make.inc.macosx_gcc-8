# Makefile variable overrides for Mac OSX compilation with GCC v.8.*

# Use this if you'll need to link against gfortran.
#
# Copy this file to make.inc, and if needed edit for your setup.
#
# Don't forget also to adjust g++ to g++-8 at start of setup.py

# By default we use clang/LLVM (which is aliased to /usr/lib/gcc, etc).
# If you want to override this, get gcc from brew then use, eg:
CXX=g++-8
CC=gcc-8
FC=gfortran

# (compile flags for use with GCC are as in linux makefile)
CFLAGS +=

# If you're getting warning messages of the form:
#    ld: warning: object file (lib-static/libfinufft.a(finufft1d.o)) was built for
#    newer OSX version (10.13) than being linked (10.9)
# Then you can uncomment the following two lines with the older version number
# (in this example -mmacosx-version-min=10.9)
#
#CFLAGS += "-mmacosx-version-min=<OLDER OSX VERSION NUMBER>"

# as in makefile, but with the brew /usr/local/ stuff...

# OpenMP with GCC on OSX needs following...
OMPFLAGS = -fopenmp
OMPLIBS = -lomp
# since fftw3_omp doesn't work in OSX, we need...

# MATLAB interface:
# some of these will depend on your FFTW library location...
MFLAGS += -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lm
