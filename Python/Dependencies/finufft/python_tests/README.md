## Accuracy and speed tests using the python wrappers

To install the python (or python3) wrappers for finufft, see ../docs/install.rst

Then you may run the tests as follows

```
python3 demo1d1.py
python3 run_accuracy_tests.py
python3 run_speed_tests.py
```

The codes `demo1d1.py` and `accuracy_speed_tests.py` illustrate how to call
FINUFFT from python.
