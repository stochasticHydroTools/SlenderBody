This directory contains Fortran wrappers to the FINUFFT C++ library,
and older test codes changed little from the CMCL NUFFT library apart from
that they call the FINUFFT library.

The interfaces are identical to those of CMCL (ie drop-in replacements),
apart from the type-1 no longer have the 1/nj normalization.
The naming is:
finufftNdM_f(...)  where N=dimensions (1,2 or 3) and M=type (1,2 or 3).

Note that, on a linux system, to compile and
link a Fortran program against the FINUFFT
library, use the following:

gfortran nufft1d_demo.f dirft1d.f -o nufft1d_demo ../lib/libfinufft.a -lstdc++ -lfftw3 -lfftw3_omp -lm -fopenmp

For Mac OSX, replace fftw3_omp by fftw3_threads.
Or, if you compiled a single-threaded version:

gfortran nufft1d_demo.f dirft1d.f -o nufft1d_demo ../lib/libfinufft.a -lstdc++ -lfftw3 -lm

Alternatively you may want to compile with g++ and use -lgfortran at the *end* of the compile statement.

See ../makefile
Eg
(cd ..; make fortran)

Finally, the default demos are double precision. The single-precision
versions have an extra "f" after the name, ie as listed by: ls *f.f
