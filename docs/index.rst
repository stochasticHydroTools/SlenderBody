Welcome to SPHARCLE's documentation!
=====================================
SPHARCLE stands for Slender Particle Hydrodynamics
And Reacting Cytoskeletal Linking Elements. 

The theoretical development of this software can be found in its entirety in Ondrej Maxian's PhD thesis:
    `Hydrodynamics of transiently cross-linked actin networks: theory, numerics, and emergent behaviors <https://www.proquest.com/docview/2832979813>`_
We recommend reading the thesis, as it contains a more organized presentation of the material from the following publications:
    1) An integral-based spectral method for inextensible slender fibers in Stokes flow, 
       by O. Maxian, A. Mogilner, and A. Donev, January 2021. 
    2) Simulations of dynamically cross-linked actin networks: morphology, rheology, and hydrodynamic interactions, 
       by O. Maxian, R. P. Pel√°ez, A. Mogilner, and A. Donev, December 2021. 
    3) Interplay between Brownian motion and cross-linking controls bundling dynamics in actin networks, 
       by O. Maxian, A. Donev, and A. Mogilner, April 2022. 
    4) The hydrodynamics of a twisting, bending, inextensible fiber in Stokes flow, by O. Maxian, B. Sprinkle, 
       C.S. Peskin, and A. Donev, July 2022. 
    5) Bending fluctuations in semiflexible, inextensible, slender filaments in Stokes flow: towards a spectral discretization, 
       by O. Maxian, B. Sprinkle, and A. Donev, April 2023.
