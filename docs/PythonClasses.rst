Source code (Python) documentation
===================================================
This page contains links to documentation of all 
the Python objects in SPHARCLE. Many of the Python
classes also have a corresponding C++ class that 
actually does the grunt work. Here we provide 
documentation for all of the python classes; the 
corresponding C++ has the same functionality and can
thus be understood using the Python documentation.
